        "summary": "This DVD presents Avatar Adi Da's Discourse of October 10, 2004. In Part 1, He describes how Reality is the true \"first experience\" for everyone--more fundamental to existence than identification with the apparently \"born\" being. In Part 2, He speaks about how music and other arts can function as extensions of Spirituality. In Part 3, He speaks about Ramana Maharshi and the sixth stage orientation, in contrast to His seventh stage Reality-Way. In Part 4, He addresses a devotee's experience of emotional trauma, and how such events can affect one's life. And in Part 5, He describes His own Submission, in His early life, to the process of Christian mystical experience.\r\n",
